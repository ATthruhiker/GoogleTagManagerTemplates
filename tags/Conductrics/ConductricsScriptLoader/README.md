See [this chapter](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/custom-templates-guide-for-google-tag-manager/#tag-template-walkthrough) for more details about the creation process.

When you create a new **Conductrics-hosted deployment** in Conductrics, the deployment will prompt you to add a `<script>` element to the page, where the `src` attribute is a URL from where the script is loaded. 

This tag template should be used to load the script, by adding the URL into the respective field (**Deployment source URL**), remembering to prefix it with `https://`.
